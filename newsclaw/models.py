"""Slice 2 data model.

The ``Candidate`` is the per-run object a feed adapter emits; it carries a
source-agnostic ``raw_signal`` (``signal_name`` + ``signal_value``) so Hacker
News points and GitHub stars flow through the same pipeline. Run-derived
annotations (``velocity``, ``is_new``, ``resurfaced``) are filled in by
``ingest`` against the persisted memory.

``SeenRecord`` is the persisted memory unit — one per ``(source, source_id)``,
stored in ``state.json``. ``Run`` is one entry in the append-only ``runs.json``
health log. Cross-source clustering into a canonical ``Item`` is deferred to the
S3 LLM, so state holds seen-records, not clustered items.

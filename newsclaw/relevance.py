"""Keyword-allowlist relevance filter.

A deliberately mechanical stopgap until the Slice 3 LLM judge does real relevance.
Terms are matched case-insensitively at a word boundary (so "rag" does not match
"storage") against the story title and url. A story is kept if any term matches;
the matched terms become its ``topics``.

The exact list is meant to be tuned after a real fetch.

# English ("skill"→"skilled") are spelled out to avoid false positives.

"""AI News Monitor — Slice 2 entry point.

Run with `python run.py`. Computes the window, fetches Hacker News and GitHub
behind their adapters, filters for relevance, folds this run's candidates into
the persisted memory (state.json) while computing velocity, selects a digest
with the stand-in selector, renders dashboard.html, appends a health record to
runs.json, and prints a one-line summary of the funnel.

No LLM and no key: the selection is a deliberately-dumb stand-in that Slice 3
replaces with the LLM judge. This slice exists to build and verify the memory +
velocity plumbing the judge will consume.
